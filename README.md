# example-vite-react

This is an example project with Vite and Reflame co-existing in the same codebase. With a setup like this, you can try out Reflame on an existing Vite project with 0 risk. 

Continue to deploy previews and production with your existing setup while enjoying Reflame's instant deploys for previews, and only switch over production deployments once you're ready for instant production deployments as well. 

Even after you've fully migrated to Reflame, you can continue to use Vite as a offline-capable backup to the online local development workflow of the Reflame VSCode extension that enables seamless sharing and full production parity.

All of the manual migration steps and explanations can be found in this PR: https://github.com/reflame/example-vite-react/pull/2
