# example-vite-react

An example of a Reflame React app with Vite.

Using Reflame and Vite together in the same codebase this way allows you to try out Reflame on a Vite project with 0 risk. 

Continue to deploy previews and production using Vite with an existing deployment service you're familiar with, while enjoying Reflame's instant previews. Only switch over production deployments once Reflame has earned your trust for instant production deploys as well. 

Even after you've fully migrated to Reflame, you can continue to use Vite as a offline-capable backup to the online local development workflow of the Reflame VSCode extension that enables seamless sharing and full production parity.

All of the manual migration steps and explanations can be found in this PR: https://github.com/reflame/example-vite-react/pull/2
